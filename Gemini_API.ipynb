            "You: hello\n",
            "Assistant: Hello! How can I help you today?\n",
            "You: Hi i want to know about thalapathy vijay cbi enquiry\n",
            "Assistant: That’s an interesting query, and it relates to a major investigation involving the popular actor.\n",
            "\n",
            "It is important to clarify that the major investigation involving Thalapathy Vijay in recent years was conducted by the **Income Tax (I-T) Department**, not the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI).\n",
            "\n",
            "Here is a summary of the widely reported Income Tax investigation and questioning:\n",
            "\n",
            "### The 2020 Income Tax Investigation\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Date and Scope:** In February 2020, the Income Tax Department launched a massive, coordinated search and seizure operation across multiple locations in Tamil Nadu.\n",
            "2.  **The Target:** The investigation was primarily focused on potential tax evasion related to the financing, production, and distribution of the actor’s blockbuster film, ***Bigil***. The raids simultaneously targeted the production house (AGS Entertainment), a major financier, and the residences and offices of the star, Vijay.\n",
            "3.  **Vijay’s Involvement:** Vijay was questioned by the I-T officials regarding his remuneration for *Bigil* and his general tax compliance. The questioning took place while he was on the set of his subsequent film, *Master*.\n",
            "4.  **Official Findings (I-T Department Report):** The Income Tax Department later issued statements indicating that they had found evidence of unaccounted cash and undisclosed income running into crores of rupees across the various parties raided, though specific figures for Vijay were not officially released by the I-T department.\n",
            "\n",
            "In summary, while Vijay was subjected to rigorous questioning and investigation by a central agency, it was the **Income Tax Department** looking into financial and tax matters, not a CBI inquiry.\n",
            "You: Not that about karur stampede vijay was questioned by cbi officails\n",
            "Assistant: That is a very specific piece of information, and it seems to be related to a rumor or a misattribution of events.\n",
            "\n",
            "Based on all verifiable public records, there is **no credible or official report** confirming that actor Thalapathy Vijay was ever questioned by the **Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI)** in connection with the **Karur stampede**.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here is a breakdown of why this information is likely inaccurate:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Agency Jurisdiction:** The major investigation that involved Vijay was conducted by the **Income Tax (I-T) Department** and was focused purely on financial matters and alleged tax evasion related to film production. The CBI handles federal crimes, corruption, and cases referred by the courts, but there is no public record of them initiating a case against Vijay concerning the stampede.\n",
            "2.  **The Karur Stampede:** The tragic incident in Karur generally refers to a stampede that occurred during a distribution event, usually linked to local political figures or schemes. While these incidents result in thorough investigations by local police (Tamil Nadu State Police) and possibly human rights or judicial inquiries, linking a major film star directly to the investigation as a suspect or key witness questioned by the CBI is unsubstantiated in media reports.\n",
            "3.  **Lack of Official Confirmation:** If a high-profile actor like Vijay were to be questioned by the CBI—a major central agency—for an event like a public disaster, it would be a huge national news story, far eclipsing the coverage of the IT raids. No such verifiable news reports exist from reliable sources (newspapers, official agency statements).\n",
            "\n",
            "**In summary, the detailed news coverage and official statements only confirm the major investigation by the Income Tax Department in 2020. The claim of CBI questioning regarding the Karur stampede remains unverified.**\n",
            "You: what are the songs in jananayagan\n",
            "Assistant: That is an interesting question!\n",
            "\n",
            "It appears there might be a slight confusion regarding the title. **\"Jananayagan\" (meaning \"People's Leader\") is not the title of a specific movie, but rather a popular nickname or moniker often used by fans and the media to refer to actor Thalapathy Vijay, especially in the context of his films with political themes (like *Sarkar* or *Mersal*).**\n",
            "\n",
            "Since you were discussing Vijay, you might be looking for the songs from one of his recent major films.\n",
            "\n",
            "To help you, could you confirm which movie you were thinking of? For example, were you looking for the songs from:\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  ***Leo*** (2023)?\n",
            "2.  ***Varisu*** (2023)?\n",
            "3.  ***Master*** (2021)?\n",
            "\n",
            "If you can confirm the correct film title, I can certainly provide you with the full list of songs!\n",
            "You: leo\n",
            "Assistant: That's a fantastic movie choice!\n",
            "\n",
            "The music for Thalapathy Vijay's 2023 blockbuster film, ***Leo*** (directed by Lokesh Kanagaraj), was composed by **Anirudh Ravichander**.\n",
            "\n",
            "Here are the main songs from the *Leo* soundtrack:\n",
            "\n",
            "| Song Title | Singer(s) | Notes |\n",
            "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",
            "| **Naa Ready (Thalapathy Version)** | Anirudh Ravichander & Vijay | The chartbuster lead single, highly popular dance track. |\n",
            "| **Badass** | Anirudh Ravichander | A high-energy, heavy theme song that served as the film’s major action motif. |\n",
            "| **Anbenum** | Anirudh Ravichander & Lothika | A soft, emotional melody focusing on the protagonist's family life. |\n",
            "| **Ordinary Person** | Anirudh Ravichander | A suspenseful, slow-burn track highlighting the protagonist's hidden past. |\n",
            "\n",
            "The full soundtrack album also includes various instrumental themes and background scores that are essential to the film's mood, such as **\"I'm Scared\"** and **\"Glimpse of Anthony Das.\"**\n",
            "You: Ok thank you\n",
            "Assistant: You are very welcome! If you have any other questions about Thalapathy Vijay, his films, or anything else, feel free to ask!\n",
            "You: hi\n",
            "Assistant: Hello! How can I help you further today?\n",
            "You: exit\n",
